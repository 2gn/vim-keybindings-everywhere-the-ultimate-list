# What is this list?
Once your fingers have [learned](https://www.thejach.com/view/2012/07/vims_learning_curve_is_wrong) to speak Vim, they don't want to speak anything else! It's simply a very effective way of navigating, creating and editing text. Thus, it's natural that one would like to get Vim-like keybindings in as many programs we use as possible.

The intention of this collaborative list is to:
* learn which programs/apps that you already use which you can enhance with Vim keybindings. Search in your browser with `ctrl/cmd + f`.
* discover new programs that support Vim keybindings. In the need for a new file manager? Why not get one that has Vim keybindings?
* be up-to-date and alive -- add new programs and extensions as they evolve!

There are of course already lists like this one floating around on the internet (see [Acknowledgments](#Acknowledgments)). While they are great, the issue is that they are not up-to-date with the latest developments. There are Vim-emulator add-ons being developed all the time! This is why this collaborative list was created.

(yes, technically it is **vi**-like keybindings we talk about here, but most people know and Google for vim, thus vim is used here instead of vi).

# The Ultimate Vim Keybinding List
The following symbols are used with each list item to make it clearer what kind of Vim keybindings support exist
* :white_check_mark: - built-in support (possibly via a setting)
* :heavy_plus_sign: - via addon/extension

Terminology:
* [TUI](https://itlaw.fandom.com/wiki/Text_user_interface) - Text User Interface

## Source Code Management
* :white_check_mark: [git](https://git-scm.com/) - Nothing's better than the real deal. Tell git to use vim/nvim when editing commit messages, interactive rebase etc. by putting in your `~/.config/git/config`:
  * ```ini
    [user]
        editor = vim
    ```
* :white_check_mark: [tig](https://jonas.github.io/tig/) - Text interface for git. Works mostly like vim out of the box, but can be enhanced:
  * <details>
      <summary>~/.config/tig/config</summary>

      ```
      bind generic <Ctrl-f>   scroll-page-down

      bind generic g move-first-line			# Move cursor to top.
      bind generic G move-last-line			# Move cursor to bottom.

      bind main B :toggle commit-title-graph		# Rebind G to B.
      bind main G move-last-line			# Move cursor to bottom.
      ```
    </details>
* :white_check_mark: [hg/mercurical](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) - Put in your `~/.config/hg/hgrc`:
  * ```ini
    [ui]
        editor = vim
    ```


## Shells
* :white_check_mark: [readline](https://man.archlinux.org/man/readline.3) - Readline is a library used by many CLI programs to read input from users. By configuring readline to use vi key bindings, you automatically get it for programs like `bash`, `irb`, `octave` etc. By default, readline has Emacs-like keybindings, but you can change that by putting this in your `~/.inputrc`:
  * ```
     set editing-mode vi
     set keymap vi-insert
  ```
* :white_check_mark: [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) - The preferred method is to set Vi mode in `~/.inputrc` via readline, as you will get Vi mode automatically in all programs using the library. However, if you just want this for bash, put this in your bash startup file e.g. `~/.bashrc`:
  * ```bash
    set -o vi
    ```
* :white_check_mark: [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) - just put this in your ZSH startup file, most likely `~/.zshrc`:
  * ```bash
    bindkey -v
    ```
  * <details>
      <summary>Extra text object keybindings</summary>

    ```bash
    # Add text object extension -- eg ci" da(:
    autoload -U select-quoted
    zle -N select-quoted
    for m in visual viopp; do
        for c in {a,i}{\',\",\`}; do
            bindkey -M $m $c select-quoted
        done
    done
    ```
    </details>
* :white_check_mark: [fish](https://fishshell.com/) - just add to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` ([reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28445450/265508)):
  * ```bash
    fish_vi_key_bindings
    ```
* :white_check_mark: [tcsh](https://www.tcsh.org/) - put this in your ksh startup file e.g. `~/.kshrc` ([reference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mac-os-x/0596004583/ch04s02.html)):
  * ```bash
    bindkey -v
    ```
* :white_check_mark: [ksh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell) - put this in your ksh startup file e.g. `~/.kshrc`:
  * ```bash
    set -o vi
    ```
* :white_check_mark: [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh) - put this in your config file e.g. `$nu.config-path`:
  * ```nu
    let-env config = {
      # ...
      edit_mode: vi,
      # ...
    }
    ```

 * âœ… [pwsh](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) - The Readline module offers support for convenient vim support. Add this to your `$Profile`:
   *
    ```
     Import-Module PSReadLine
     # enable Vim on the shell and as editor
     $OnViModeChange = [scriptblock]{
        if ($args[0] -eq 'Command') {
            # Set the cursor to a blinking block.
            Write-Host -NoNewLine "`e[2 q"
        }
        else {
            # Set the cursor to a blinking line.
            Write-Host -NoNewLine "`e[5 q"
        }
     }

     Set-PsReadLineOption -EditMode Vi
     Set-PSReadLineOption -ViModeIndicator Script -ViModeChangeHandler $OnViModeChange
    ```
   * This was collected from many github issues and posts. Powershell 5.1 for one reason or another refuses to change the cursor so the script to give
    feedback does not work. Just remove it and it will still work, just no feedback of the mode you're in.
