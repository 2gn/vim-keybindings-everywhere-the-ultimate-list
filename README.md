# What is this list?
Once your fingers have [learned](https://www.thejach.com/view/2012/07/vims_learning_curve_is_wrong) to speak Vim, they do'nt not want to speak anything else! It's simply a very effective way of navigating, creating and editing text. Thus, it's natual that one would like to get Vim-like keybindings in as many programs we use as possible.

The intention of this collaborative list is to:
* learn which programs/apps that you already use which you can enhance with Vim keybindings
* discover new programs that supports Vim keybindings. In the need for a new file manager? Why not get one that has Vim keybindigns?
* be up to date and alive -- add new programs and extensions as they evolve!

There are of course already lists like this one ([1](https://www.slant.co/topics/7131/~programming-text-editors-with-vim-key-bindings), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/3tluqr/my_list_of_applications_with_vi_keybindings/)) floating around on the internet. While they are great, the issue is that they are not up to date with the latest developments. There are Vim-emulator addons being developed all the time! This is why this collaborative list was created.

# The Ultimate Vim Keybinding List
The following symbols are used with each list item to make it clearer what kind of Vim keybindings support exist
* :white_check_mark: - built-in support (possibly via a setting)
* :heavy_plus_sign: - via addon/extension

# General
* [vim-anywhere](https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere) - spawn a vim buffer from any text input in the operating system.

## Web browsers

## IDEs
* :heavy_plus_sign: Jetbrain's Intellij, PYCharm, PHPStorm, - ...

## Text Editors
We know that Vi-[clones](http://www.linfo.org/vi/clones.html)/derivatives have Vi(m) keybindings so let's skip those here (Vim, NeoVim, vile, ...)

* Atom
  * :heavy_plus_sign: [atom-vim-mode-plus](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus)
* Emacs
  *

## Commandline Shells
