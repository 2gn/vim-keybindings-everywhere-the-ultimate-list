# What is this list?
Once your fingers have learned to speak Vim, they do'nt not want to speak anything else! It's simply a very effective way of navigating, creating and editing text. Thus, it's natual that one would like to get Vim-like keybindings in as many programs we use as possible.

The intention of this collaborative list is to:
* learn which programs/apps that you already use which you can enhance with Vim keybindings
* discover new programs that supports Vim keybindings. In the need for a new file manager? Why not get one that has Vim keybindigns?
* be up to date and alive -- add new programs and extensions as they evolve!

# The Ultimate Vim Keybinding List

## Web browsers
## Text Editors
We know that Vi-[clones](http://www.linfo.org/vi/clones.html)/derivatives have Vi(m) keybindings so let's skip those here (Vim, NeoVim, vile, ...)
